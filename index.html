  <!-- Instructions -->
  <div id="howtoplay">
     <p>
       * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
     </p>

     <p>
       * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount
         of points to the player's total score.
     </p>

     <p>
       * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     </p>

     <p>
       * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
     </p>

     <p>
       * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
     </p>

     <p>
       * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
     </p>

     <p>
       * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
     </p>

     <p>
       * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also,
             all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score
             (and score counter) will reset to zero.
     </p>

     <p>
       * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end,
         do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
     </p>
